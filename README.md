# 🚀 Machine Learning Classification Project

This repository contains a machine learning project built in Python using `scikit-learn` and `pandas`. The goal of the project is to perform classification on a dataset by applying data preprocessing, training different models, and evaluating their performance.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Projekti1.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the full pipeline — from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
- `dataset.csv`: *(Assuming your dataset is local and referenced in the notebook)*

## 🔍 What This Project Does

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handles missing values
   - Label encoding for categorical features
   - Normalization using `StandardScaler`

2. **Model Training**:
   - Trains multiple classifiers:
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Decision Tree
     - Logistic Regression

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Compares models using accuracy scores
   - Confusion matrix for visual understanding

4. **Model Selection**:
   - Best model is selected based on performance metrics

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
